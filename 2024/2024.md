###### heres where I will be posting my solutions to the 2024 advent of code problems, I will be doing this in python as I have no want to be learning a new language this year, and python is the one I am most comfortable in, my goal is to get into the top 1000 one day at least once.
###### I will also be writing about any days that I found particularly interesting or difficult, or any days that I struggled an unreasonable amount with because I simply didn't see the obvious solution.
